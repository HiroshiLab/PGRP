## Evolutionary timing of Tyr-lignin pathway:

While most of the plants synthesize lignin and other phenylpropanoid exclusively from L-phenylalanine, grasses have gained the ability to use tyrosine as a precursor of these family of compounds, shortcutting their biosynthesis **(Figure 1.1)**. This trait of grasses would have impacted the structure of their secondary cell walls, a topic of particular interest in biofuel research due to the extensive use of these family of plants as crops. Fundamental understanding of the tyrosine-derived lignin and other natural product pathways will enable optimization of amino acid and cell wall biosynthesis to improve yield and quality of foods, fuels, and biomaterials. Our phylogenetic analysis of a large set of PAL enzyme sequences from many monocots plants indicates that Histidine at position 89, a key residue for the use of tyrosine as alternative substrate (Barros and Dixon 2019), occurred for the first time in the grass ancestor *Joinvillea ascendens*. The mutation His-89 on PAL, that confers the ability to use tyrosine as substrate, occurred in the ancestors of grasses.

**Figure 1.2:** grasses have a recent duplication in TyrA gene family giving place to the isoforms TyrA1 and TyrA2, which do not exist in other monocots or dicots. In addition, grasses and other monocots have retained an additional isoform (TyrA3) that seems to have been lost in Arabidopsis and other dicots.
